      "part2": "I was learning how to design GUIs (and I was having issues with it), so I thought it would be nice to have some screen recordings so I could ask for help in forums.",
      "part3": "While some apps already existed, they didn't provide the specific feature that I needed, which prompted me to build my own solution (not realizing it would require a lot of work).",
      "part4": "The name 'ScreenToGif' is as simple as I guessed the tool would be: a screen recorder that exported as gif. It was supposed to be an easy to remember name.",
      "part5": "But I had no foreshadowing powers: The only part of the name that stays relevant is the middle 'To', as the app can now capture more than the screen and export to other formats.",
      "part6": "This project had a complete restart in 2016, after some months having issues with the old platform, I ended up switching to a new one.",
      "part7": "This transition allowed me to develop more features, with easier to understand user interfaces.",
      "part8": "Although I'm the creator and maintainer of this project, other users also contribute with bug reports, feature requests and translations. Feel free to leave your comment. :)"
